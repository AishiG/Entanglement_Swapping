# Entanglement_Swapping

This code is a supplement to the paper "Understanding entanglement swapping through a classical model of light." There is a brief description provided in the python notebook. I would suggest running the .ipynb file on anaconda, Jupyter notebooks, with a folder for storing the files produced. There are two kinds of files produced and called on in the notebook. One for Bell State arrays of complex gaussian amplitudes, and another for storing Fidelity, Bell statistic arrays and density matrices. Both files are stored in the same place. The original work was done using MATLAB scripts, so the .m files for those scripts are also provided. There are separate scripts for Bell State Generation, QST, and Graphing. The .ipynb file is better for getting a sense of the simulation and quickly make visualizations. The exact results displayed in the python notebook are different from the results from the MATLAB simulation and paper because different and fewer Bell states were generated for the python notebook. The results may be found to concur if more initializations are run.
