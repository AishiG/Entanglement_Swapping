# Entanglement_Swapping

This code is a supplement to the paper "Understanding entanglement swapping through a classical model of light." There is a brief description provided in the python notebook. I would suggest running it on anaconda, Jupyter notebooks, with a folder for storing the files produced. There are two kinds of files produced and called on in the notebook. One for Bell State arrays of complex gaussian amplitudes, and another for storing Fidelity, Bellstatistic arrays and density matrices.
