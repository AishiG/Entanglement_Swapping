# Entanglement_Swapping

This code is a supplement to the paper "Understanding entanglement swapping through a classical model of light." There is a brief description provided in the python notebook. I would suggest running it on anaconda, Jupyter notebooks, with a folder for storing the files produced. There are two kinds of files produced and called on in the notebook.
